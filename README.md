# Gauss-Elimination
Creating Gaussian Elimination with premade Matrix Class

## Quick start:
1. create new Mat object with a = Mat(li) where li is a list of lists of numbers that all have the same length
2. b = Mat.from_input() prompts you to enter values for each row separated by spaces
3. supported operations/methods:
⋅⋅⋅ addition
⋅⋅⋅ subtraction
⋅⋅⋅ multiplication
⋅⋅⋅ scalar multiplication
⋅⋅⋅ transpose
⋅⋅⋅ determinant
⋅⋅⋅ inverse
