# Gauss-Elimination
Creating Gaussian Elimination with premade Matrix Class for my class project.

## Quick start:
1. Creating new Matrix object with a = Matrix(m,n) where m is the rows and n is the columns of the matrix.
    *Note that the Matrix created starts with zeroes*
2. Matrix.readStdin() prompts you to enter values for each row separated by spaces
3. Supported Operations/methods in [Matrix.py](https://github.com/grafaelw/Gauss-Elimination/blob/main/Matrix.py)
* +,-,*
* scalar multiplication
* transpose
* ones  (generating ones-Matrix
* zeros (generating zero-Matrix)
* random (generating random Matrix)
* addCols (Adding Columns)
* addRows (Adding Rows)
* shape
* save (Saving Matrix)
* readGrid (reading Matrix from a file)
4. In [gaussian.py](https://github.com/grafaelw/Gauss-Elimination/blob/main/Matrix.py), the output x __must__ be a list.
